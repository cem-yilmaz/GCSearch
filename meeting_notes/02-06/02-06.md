- What have we all done so far
	- Cem made an instagram parser and recently (this morning) got access to a larger dataset just today
	- Yu-Shin exported LINE chat
	- Ray mentioned photos maybe needing ocr \[WeChat]
		- photos potentially linked to server 
		- (optionally download if possible)
			- if photos cant be linked say "download is only possible option"
				- in cases of this give option to OCR photos
	- Efe uploaded CW1 submission
		- brainstormed
- Tasks needing decided
	- we should get started on a frontend that can dynamically generate chats
	- we need to decide on one consistent format for our pii
		- and decide whether we combine these together
	- do we need a consistent format between chat exports, so we can make one parser for it? 
	- \[**Immediate**] Write up a guide on how you exported your data
- Teams needing allocated
	- look up chinese/turkish stopwords/tokenisers
	- **Team to decode chinese language github project**
		- Ray Layla Yu-Shin
	- **OCR team**
		- Cem Efe Ray
	- **Frontend team**
		- make frontend app
		- probably atleast 2 people
		- will need to be memory efficient and have a good "jump to" capabilities
			- this can be in tandem with the backend team
		- Efe, Ray, Cem
	- **Backend team**
		- responsible for making the Flask server that powers 
		- Cem, 
	- **PII optimiser team**
		- Regardless of chat format, we will need one consistent PII for the whole thing. Memory optimisation etc
		- Make interface for PII (get postings for word etc.)
		- **PII must be memory optimised and algorithmically optimised**
			- Take notes of these improvements for our eventual writeup
		- Efe, Yu-Shin, Layla \*(but Ray and Cem might pop in for help)
	- **Parser teams**
		- by extension **tokeniser teams**
			- whateqver language we speak
	- **Statistics team**
# Next week
- (try) to get a full archive->chatlog for each of ur respective tasks
